## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  - I assume the stadium has an ovalish shape and contains a roof, playing field, and seating area, as well as a surrounding walkway for stalls and concessions. I will also assume the stadium in question includes a parking lot and doesn't border any buildings, bodies of water, or parks.  
- Assets:
  - Spectators
    - People
        - The spectators vastly outnumber any other group of people in the stadium and directly contribute to revenue by purchasing (one-time or season) tickets, food, and team merchandise. Any harm to the public spectators would cause a news frenzy and feelings of distrust and fear. This may lead to a decline in attendance at games. 
    - Property
        - Most fans arrive at the stadium by car and must park their vehicles. At packed games, this means a multitude of cars either in a garage or out in the open. Further, many times, large items are not allowed in the stadium and can either be left in the car or coat-checked by a third-party service. We must ensure cars are not stolen, broken into, or damaged and that coat-checked items are safely kept and returned at the end of the game. If not, the public may start to question our stadium security and feel unsafe. 
  - Teams
    - Players/Coaches
        - This asset refers to both the home and away teams. If players are attacked either physically or non-physically, they may be less inclined to return to the field. Even if they end up playing again, they may be preoccupied about their safety and not perform at their best. As for the coaches, they oversee play calls and overall strategy. Most offensive/defensive coaches wear headsets, so we need to make sure the microphones and/or sound-waves travelling through the air are not compromised.  
    - Playbooks/Strategy
        - Many times, physical copies of playbooks float around the team's bench area. For the integrity of the sport and to ensure fans continue to believe games aren't rigged or fixed, we need to protect each team's playbook in the name of fairness. 
  - Stadium Staff
        - Once again, like the spectators and players, the staff are people and their safety matters. Further, these people have special access to the stadium as they are employees so we must ensure they aren't engaging in dangerous/illegal behaviors. 
  - Stadium Structure 
        - This asset is where all the above assets reside. We must ensure there is no danger to the stadium's structure as any weakness can force the whole stadium to collapse. This can cause irreplaceable damage including the loss of human lives and millions of dollars. 
- Threats:
  - Small Crimes
    - Vandalism/Damage/Theft
        - We would want to protect the stadium from any vandalism and damage. Further, we must ensure any personal belongings (items and potential cars) are not compromised. Otherwise, our stadium may gain a reputation of being unsafe. 
    - Illegal Selling of Tickets
        - Many times, right before the start of a game, people sell bootlegged tickets right outside the stadium. We want to minimize this activity. 
    - Violence
        - We want to make sure no one gets hurt at any point in the game. Fights can often break out at big rivalry games and tensions are high. 
  - Terrorism
    - We would want to defend against any terrorist attack as this would affect any people in the stadium as well as the structure of the stadium.
  - Open Roof
    - There is of course an opportunity for a terrorist air attack if the roof is open. Additionally, there is a possibility of severe weather including lightning, winds, and hail. For the safety of the people in the stadium, we must protect against these climate threats. 
  - Box Seats Being Sabotaged 
    - Many companies and high-profile organizations have box seats at stadiums. We should protect these box suites especially as they are often the result of highly profitable parternships and sponsorships. 
- Countermeasures:
  - Having Security At Many Locations
    - We would want to have a special team assigned to the parking lot to ensure safety of the cars and other personal belongings. Police stationed here would also decrease the sale of illegal tickets. This in turn would increase public trust and potential revenue from legal, direct-from-stadium or through verified partner sales. 
    - We would also want to have security at the many stadium entrances to check bags and people as they enter the premises, as well as security around the walkways connecting the stadium seats to the concession stands and other stalls. This would also protect people in the box suites. Seeing people in uniform all around the stadium has two benefits: actual safety and believed safety, meaning people will be more likely to show-up to and stay at games. 
  - Ensuring Newest Technologies
    - To combat against counterfeit tickets, we should ensure our barcode scanners use the latest technologies. As for the coaches' microphones, we want to ensure there is sufficient end-to-end encryption. Further, we should encourage teams to view their playbooks on secure, digital devices rather than on paper. New technology can be quite expensive in the short-term because of initial costs, but once the system has been fully integrated, the stadium will see more money from ticket sales and teams will feel better about communication on the field.
  - Automatic Roof-Closing System
    - For the roof, we should have an automatic system that triggers in case of severe weather and alerts chief operators at the stadium, while automatically closing the roof to keep the area safe. This is a must have and there really is only a one-time cost of implementation, and then a low maintenance cost thereafter.
  - Natural Disaster Response
    - The stadium should be built to withstand earthquakes and high-winds. This is usually part of city/state-wide codes and regulations anyway.
  - Vetting Stadium Staff
    - We should make sure we have rigorous background-checks and psychological assessments conducted of our staff members on a regular basis (maybe every year). We should also ensure we are using secure credentials like badges and pin codes. Re-vetting staff is a costly procedure and has many administrative costs. Of all the countermeasures I propose, this should be implemented last as it has only a moderate benefit, compared to the significant cost.
